## VAST Mini-Challenge 3

Seismic and survey data are useful for capturing the objective damage that the earthquake has caused St. Himark. However, this data has limitations. First, official surveys are time consuming and do not stay current in a rapidly changing situation. Second, they don’t establish how citizens are reacting to the current crisis. Third, they are often insufficiently granular, providing little insight into differences between neighborhoods. In other words, the seismic and survey data do not provide an up-to-date view of the structural and humanitarian impact caused by the earthquake on a neighborhood-by-neighborhood basis. The City has concluded that this knowledge is necessary to determine where to allocate emergency resources.

City Officials have identified a subset of Y*INT, a community-based social media platform, as a potential source for revealing the current state of St. Himark’s neighborhoods and people. Knowing that you are skilled in visual analytics, the City has asked you to analyze Y*INT messages in order to determine the appropriate actions it must take in order to assist the community in this disaster.

### Tasks

1. Characterize conditions across the city and recommend how resources should be allocated.
2. Identify the conditions before and after the inflection point and the affected locations.
3. What is the community experiencing?
4. Explain how you are using static or dynamic stream of data for analysis.
